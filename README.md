My i3-gaps config. I'm using i3-gaps instead of i3 because i3-gaps supports transparency, which is something I wanted, especially for the i3bar.
Things I'm using:

- Bar: i3bar with i3blocks
- Terminal: termite (powerline sometimes)
- font: font awesome, hack, and ubuntu
- compositing: compton (added custom blur kernel)
- d-menu: rofi
- theme: Ambiance-Blackout-Flat-Red-Pro
- OS: Ubuntu
- notifications: dunst
- calendar: gsimplecal
- lock: i3-lock-colors
- web-browser: chrome
- file-browser: nautilus

Notes:

- volume and brightness are clickable and scrollable
- battery block shows when computer is being plugged in, charging, discharging, etc (changes colors as well)
- mediaplayer at top is clickable
- custom icons for slack and pia
- screenshot utility is maim
- date/time is clickable, shows gsimplecal (very similar to ubuntu)
- some lines in i3 config for setting up natural scrolling for my laptop (near bottom)
